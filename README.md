# biobutanol-reaction-kinetics-modelling

Modelling of batch fermentation producing butanol from glucose via acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation with *C. Acetobutylicum*.

Model results (showing concentrations of different species):

Sensitivity analysis with respect to starting biomass concentration, showing concentration of bacterial biomass (X), glucose (S) and butanol (B). Note the simulation stopping once the butanol concentration reaches the toxic limit for the bacteria:
